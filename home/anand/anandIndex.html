It is a big country divided into 29 states and 7 union territories. These states and union territories have been created so that the government can run the country more easily. India also has many different kinds of physical features in different parts of the country that are spread over its states and union territories. India is a very diverse country as well, which means that the people around the country are different in many ways. Even though India is such a diverse place, it is united as one country.
